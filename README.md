# riteraft-py

⚠️ This repository is porting of [riteraft](https://github.com/ritelabs/riteraft) and no longer maintained. If you're looking for a high-level Raft implementation, you can check out [riteraft-ng](https://github.com/lablup/riteraft-ng), which is a fork of `riteraft-py`.

---

*riteraft-py* is an attempt to provide a *higher-level [Raft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_(algorithm)) implementation* in Python based on *[rraft-py](https://github.com/lablup/rraft-py)*.

Please note that this repository is still experimental and has not been tested thoroughly.

Also, if you want to build featureful Raft implementation, *rraft-py* could be a good starting point instead of this lib.

> Note: Although this library originated from *ritelabs/riteraft*, it does not guarantee to provide the same API with *ritelabs/riteraft*, API could change.

## Why?

Since *[raft-rs](https://github.com/tikv/raft-rs)* only offers an implementation for the consensus module, it appears that users may encounter difficulties figuring out how to utilize this library when they first encounter the problem. (Refer: https://github.com/tikv/raft-rs/issues/402)

Attempts to provide a higher-level Raft implementation, such as *[riteraft](https://github.com/tikv/raft-rs/issues/402)*, have been made to address this issue.

This repository utilizes *riteraft* as a starting point to resolve the issue in Python.

## Getting started

### Installation

TBU

<!-- #### With pip

```
$ pip install riteraft
``` -->

### Example

To use Raft storage, we need to implement Storage for it. Below is an example with HashStore, which is a thread-safe wrapper around a HashMap.

```py
class HashStore:
    def __init__(self):
        self._store = dict()
        self._lock = Lock()

    def get(self, key: int) -> Optional[str]:
        with self._lock:
            return self._store.get(key)

    async def apply(self, msg: bytes) -> bytes:
        with self._lock:
            message = InsertMessage.decode(msg)
            self._store[message.key] = message.value
            logging.info(f'Inserted: ({message.key}, "{message.value}")')
            return pickle.dumps(message.value)

    async def snapshot(self) -> bytes:
        with self._lock:
            return pickle.dumps(self._store)

    async def restore(self, snapshot: bytes) -> None:
        with self._lock:
            self._store = pickle.loads(snapshot)
```

Only 3 methods need to be implemented for the `Store`:

* `apply`: applies a committed entry to the store.
* `snapshot`: returns snapshot data for the store.
* `restore`: applies the snapshot passed as argument.

#### Running the raft

```py
async def main() -> None:
    setup_logger()
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("--raft-addr", required=True)
    parser.add_argument("--peer-addr", default=None)
    parser.add_argument("--web-server", default=None)

    args = parser.parse_args()

    options = Options(
        raft_addr=args.raft_addr,
        peer_addr=args.peer_addr,
        web_server=args.web_server,
    )

    store = HashStore()
    raft = Raft(options.raft_addr, store, logger)
    mailbox = raft.mailbox()

    tasks = []
    if options.peer_addr:
        logger.info("Running in follower mode")
        tasks.append(raft.join(options.peer_addr))
    else:
        logger.info("Running in leader mode")
        tasks.append(raft.lead())

    runner = None
    if options.web_server:
        app = Application()
        app.add_routes(routes)
        app["state"] = {
            "store": store,
            "mailbox": mailbox,
        }

        host, port = options.web_server.split(":")
        runner = web.AppRunner(app)
        await runner.setup()
        site = web.TCPSite(runner, host, port)
        tasks.append(site.start())

    try:
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    finally:
        if runner:
            await runner.cleanup()
            await runner.shutdown()
```

The `mailbox` provides a method to interact with the raft, such as sending a message or leaving the cluster, for example.
